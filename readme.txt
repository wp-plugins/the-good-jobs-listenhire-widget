About The Good Jobs:
At The Good Jobs, we help companies like yours showcase all the great benefits, perks & amenities that you offer your employees. We make sure that potential candidates understand what you have to offer. We help you leverage the ways you invest in your employees so you can attract & retain the right talent that is aligned with your culture. Zappos uses The Good Jobs to help tell their story, for example.

What we’re not:
The Good Jobs is not a job board, placement agency, or RPO. We want to help you to solve a problem: many job seekers don't know enough about all the good things you offer your employees. We believe that your company culture is your greatest strength and yet most companies are not using it to their advantage. Through our simple solution, we will help you quantify your culture and supplement your recruiting efforts! Easily optimize all of your recruiting channels including: job boards, ATS platforms, your website, social media, email messages, even offline.

Quite simply:
We provide you with the “Culture Marketing” that allows better transparency for those applying for positions on your website or actively searching via third party sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
